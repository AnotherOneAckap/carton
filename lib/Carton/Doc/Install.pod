=head1 NAME

carton-install - Install the dependencies

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  carton install [--deployment] [--path=PATH] [modules...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Install the dependencies for your application. This command has two
modes and the behavior is slightly different.

=head2 DEVELOPMENT MODE

=over 4

=item carton install <name>

If you run C<carton install> with the arguments, carton will fetch and
install the modules given as arguments.

=item carton install (no arguments)

If you run C<carton install> for the first itme, or your build file
(C<Makefile.PL> or C<Build.PL>) is updated (i.e. its modification time
is newer than C<carton.lock> file), carton will fetch all the
dependencies specified in your build file, resolve dependencies and
install all required modules.

=back

In the development mode, carton will analyze all the dependencies and
their version information, and it is saved into C<carton.lock>
file. It is important to add C<carton.lock> file into a version
controlled repository and commit the changes as you update your
dependencies.

=head2 DEPLOYMENT MODE

If you specify the C<--deployment> command line option or your
C<carton.lock> exists and is newer than your build file, carton will
fetch all remote modules and use the dependencies specified in the
C<carton.lock> instead of resolving dependencies.

=head1 CONSERVATIVE UPDATE

C<carton install> doesn't update the modules already installed into
C<local> library path as long as the version is satisfied.

For example, one day you install URI-1.50 from CPAN:

  > carton install URI
  Successfully installed URI-1.50

Few weeks later, URI module is updated to 1.51 on CPAN. If you run the
C<carton install URI> again:

  > carton install URI
  You have URI (1.50)

because you haven't specified the version number, carton won't update
the module in your local library path. If you want to update to the
latest version of CPAN, you can either use C<carton update> command,
or specify the required version either in your build file or a command
line argument:

 > carton install URI@1.51
 > carton update URI

 > cat Makefile.PL
 requires 'URI', 1.51;

Any of those will upgrade URI to the latest one from CPAN, and the
version specified in the C<carton.lock> will be bumped.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --deployment

Force the deployment mode and carton will ignore build file contents.

=item --path

Specify the path to install modules to. Defaults to C<local> in the current directory.
