NAME
    carton - Perl module dependency manager (aka Bundler for Perl)

SYNOPSIS
      # During the development
      > carton install Plack
      > carton install Starman
      > git commit -m "add Plack and Starman" carton.json

      # Then elsewhere (on a deployment machine)
      > carton install
      > carton exec starman -p 8080

WARNING
    This software is under the heavy development and considered alpha
    quality till the version hits v1.0.0. Things might be broken, and APIs
    will be likely to change. You have been warned.

DESCRIPTION
    carton is a command line tool to track the Perl module dependencies for
    your Perl application.

TUTORIAL
  Initializing your carton environment
    First, you have to initialize your carton environment.

      > cd ~/devel/MyApp
      > carton init
      > echo extlib >> .gitignore
      > git add .gitignore carton.json
      > git commit -m "initialized carton"

    This will create an empty extlib directory and "carton.json" to start
    tracking your dependencies.

  Tracking the dependencies
    You have two options to add and track your dependencies.

    First is just install dependencies to your application as you go.

      > carton install Plack
      > carton install AnyEvent::Redis

    Second is to manage it via the standard "Makefile.PL" or "Build.PL".

      # Makefile.PL
      use inc::Module::Install;
      name 'MyApp';
      requires 'DBD::mysql';
      requires 'HTTP::Message', 5.800;
      WriteAll;

    And then you can install these dependencies via:

      > carton install

    In either way, the modules are installed into your "extlib" directory
    with the history information and "carton.json" in your directory is
    updated.

    Make sure you add "carton.json" to your version controlled repository
    and commit changes as you update dependencies.

  Deploying your application
    Once you've done installing all the dependencies, you can push your
    application directory to a remote machine and run the following:

      > carton install

    This will look at the "carton.json" and install the exact same versions
    of the dependencies into "extlib", and now your application is ready to
    run.

  Bundling modules
    carton can bundle all the tarballs for your dependencies into a
    directory so that you can even install dependencies that are not
    available on CPAN, such as internal distribution aka DarkPAN.

      > carton bundle

    will bundle these tarballs into "extlib/cache" directory, and

      > carton install --cached

    will install modules using this local cache. This way you can avoid a
    dependency on CPAN meta DB and search.cpan.org at a deploy time, or you
    can have dependencies onto private CPAN modules aka DarkPAN.
